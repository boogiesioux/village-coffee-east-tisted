<section class="about-section">
  <h2>Welcome to Village Coffee</h2>

  <p>We are Carl and Meg, owners of The Village Coffee Trailer in East Tisted. Conveniently located close to the A32 and along the East Tisted–Selborne road (Station Road), our trailer makes an ideal stopping point for anyone looking to enjoy locally produced refreshments.</p>

  <p>We serve great coffee, a much‑loved hot chocolate, alongside a selection of cakes and bakes made right here in East Tisted.</p>

  <p>We have plenty of parking and welcome visitors however they travel — on foot, by bike, by car, or anything in between. Being a rural spot, we are of course dog friendly (we just ask that dogs stay on a lead). Do ask us for a treat for your canine companion.</p>

  <p>We have the most beautiful tracks and paths to walk along around our village, as well as being able to connect with other villages such as Newton Valance, Farringdon and Colemore. We are happy to point you in the right direction.</p>

  <p>From our recent customer survey, we’re proud to share that many visitors appreciate the warm and friendly atmosphere, often describing Village Coffee as a wonderful place for friendship, conversation, and community connection. Our seating area offers a unique, relaxed space to enjoy the fresh air while indulging in something tasty.</p>

  <p><strong>We are currently open Thursday and Friday 7.30 am until 2pm and Saturday 9am – 2pm.</strong></p>

  <p>With good prices, friendly service, and a genuine sense of community, Village Coffee has become a cherished part of the locality — and we’d be delighted to welcome your group as part of that.</p>

 Please feel free to come back to our ‘social secretary’, <a href="mailto:yourname@example.com">Sioux</a>, if you have any questions. </p>
